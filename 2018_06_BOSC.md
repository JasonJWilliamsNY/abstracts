##  Title: Improving the Bioinformatics Curriculum
#### Event: Galaxy Community Conference/ Bioinformatics Open Source Conference
#### Date: June 27-28, 2018
#### Location: Portland, OR

### Abstract:

Like practitioners of any academic discipline, bioinformaticians balance their
time between research and teaching. However, bioinformaticians are frequently
called upon to teach in a wider variety of capacities –  from informal training
for colleagues and collaborators to reaching into the undergraduate curriculum.
Additionally, bioinformatics is uniquely positioned in its commitments to core
principles, from open-source to FAIR. How do these principles shape and extend
the curriculum beyond the simple use of an algorithm or analysis of a dataset?

Starting with the undergraduate curriculum, this talk presents recent findings
by NIBLSE (pronounced “nibbles”), the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics in
Life Sciences Education. In 2016, NIBLSE conducted the largest survey to date on
undergraduate bioinformatics education in the U.S. The survey revealed that 95%
of faculty believe bioinformatics should be taught, but only 40% manage to do so
(with clear disparities for faculty at less-resourced institutions). Input from
the survey and a NIBLSE working group has also generated a set of bioinformatics
competencies for undergraduate bioinformatics. In the graduate arena, a recent
PNAS article (Feldon et.al. 2017) suggests informal learning, such as boot camps
and workshops, are not effective, but preliminary results from Software and Data
Carpentry assessments suggests that in the right context, training can achieve
results. Finally, a survey of NSF-funded investigators in the biological
sciences (Barone et.al. 2017) conclude that training in several areas of
bioinformatics are the most unmet need for established researchers.

Since bioinformatics is usually taught by bioinformaticians rather than biology
educators in general, this talk highlights challenges and opportunities
surrounding bioinformatics training, and aims to spark conversation on ways
bioinformaticians can and should shape the training landscape.

# How to contribute

While I am embarrassed (but gratified) you care enough to comment or submit a PR
against my grammatical mistakes and typos, I hope the abstract might spark ideas about
topics you think I should address, preferably with references, examples, etc. Filing
Issues would be better than typo fixes (esp. since this is submitted, but I will
pass these along if there is time to fix before printing). Will also credit you
in my slides! To make a suggestion (aka an Issue), click the "Issues" tab at the
top of this page.

# Why do this?

If you have given an invited talk, sometimes you get to speak with faculty,
students before the talk, perhaps for several hours. This has always been
valuable to help me test and clarify ideas I want to communicate. Why not open
that to an internet of people who know more than me! Also, if you come to my
talk you can make it less boring by suggesting cute puppy photos, gifs, etc.
you get the idea. I think this process is most productive if I open up the
abstract, and then make the slides myself.
