##  Title: Data, Data Everywhere, Nor any a Drop to Drink
#### Event: American Society of Plant Biology - Southern Section Annual Meeting
#### Date: March 24-26, 2018
#### Location: New Orleans, LA

### Abstract:

Since the sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome in 2000, plant science like all
of the biological sciences has been transformed by the availability of genomics
data. Nearly 20 years later, and at the 10th anniversary of low-cost,
high-throughput sequencing, the aspirational goal post many are still in search
of - deriving insight from genomics - has moved into remoter and more unfamiliar
territories such as machine vision and deep learning. Big Data is easy, big
knowledge, not so much.

This talk will outline problems, opportunities, and challenges that plant
biologists face, from the perspective of current students whose future academic
aims, questions, and methods will look less-and-less like those they were
trained in. We will detail ways in which current training is likely to fail and
what solutions available today may address some critical issues. Ultimately,
driving (rather than being driven by) the advance of technology will require
attention to cultivating interdisciplinary approaches and emphasizing diverse
skills, ethical perspectives, and people. While the future is as unpredictable
as ever, there is a community responsibility to consider how our steps now can
shape the trajectory (if not the details) of the science to come.


# How to contribute

While I am embarrassed (but gratified) you care enough to comment or submit a PR
against my grammatical mistakes and typos, I hope the abstract might spark ideas about
topics you think I should address, preferably with references, examples, etc. Filing
Issues would be better than typo fixes (esp. since this is submitted, but I will
pass these along if there is time to fix before printing). Will also credit you
in my slides!

# Why do this?

If you have given an invited talk, sometimes you get to speak with faculty,
students before the talk, perhaps for several hours. This has always been
valuable to help me test and clarify ideas I want to communicate. Why not open
that to an internet of people who know more than me! Also, if you come to my
talk you can make it less boring by suggesting cute puppy photos, gifs, etc.
you get the idea. I think this process is most productive if I open up the
abstract, and then make the slides myself.
